# FileParser
implement a program that will take any such text file as input and create three files which will contain the output from the file parser based on the below mentioned three criteria. All three files must have the total word count available on the very first line.
1. First file, to be named “vowel_verbiage.txt”, would contain all the words from the input file which have more than three vowels in them. For example, the word “volunteer” has 4 vowels: o, u e, e.
2. Second file, to be named “obsessive_o.txt”, would contain all the words from the input file which start with an “o”.
3. Third file, to be named “distinct_data.txt”, would contain all the distinct words from the input file. For instance, if “the” appears 50 times, it would appear only once in the file.
